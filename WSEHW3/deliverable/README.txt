To compile:

run compile.sh

To run:

run run.sh with the usual parameters.

Please note that I added an extra parameter "l" to denote usage of a local
directory. If you don't include this flag, the program will assume that the
argument passed to the "docs" flag is an URL that points to the collection
directory.
